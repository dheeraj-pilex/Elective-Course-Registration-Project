# Elective-Course-Registration-Project
Overview
The Elective Course Registration System is a web-based application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). This system provides a seamless and efficient way for students to register for elective courses and for administrators to manage course offerings, student registrations, and user data. The application allows real-time updates, ensuring smooth course registration and management.

Features
Student Registration: Students can view available courses and register for electives with ease.

Real-Time Updates: Course availability is updated in real-time, preventing overcrowded courses and ensuring fair access.

Course Management: Administrators can add, update, and remove courses as required.

Student Management: Admins can track student registrations, monitor attendance, and manage user data.

Real-Time Monitoring: Admins can monitor course registration statistics in real-time to ensure fair distribution of courses.

Notifications: Students receive notifications for important updates, such as course registration deadlines and seat availability.

Authentication: Secure login for both students and administrators using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).

Tech Stack
Frontend:

React.js: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, providing a smooth and dynamic user experience through Single Page Applications (SPAs).

React Hooks: useState and useEffect are used to manage state and handle side-effects like fetching data.

Backend:

Node.js: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, ideal for building real-time applications.

Express.js: A web framework for Node.js, used to simplify the process of creating APIs and handling requests.

Database:

MongoDB: A NoSQL database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents, ideal for this application's scalability.

Mongoose: An ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB, providing schema-based data models for consistency and validation.
